This project is about basics of graphic programming, and in particular how
to place points in space, how to join them with segments and most importantly how to
observe the scene from a particular viewpoint.

I learned my first graphic library: miniLibX. This library was developed
internally and includes the minimum necessary to open a window, light a pixel and deal
with events linked to this window: keyboard and mouse. This project introduced me to
“events” programming.
